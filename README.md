# Html, Css Fundamentals

This repository contains a few small projects I worked on while learning HTML and CSS fundamentals. The projects are, as following:

* 02-HTML-Fundamentals, 03-CSS-Fundamentals contain a small blog post created with html, flexbox and CSS grid
* 05-Design contains a small presentation site where I also used flexbox and CSS grid
* 06-Components contains a few small components made only with CSS: accordion, carousel, table, pagination and a small hero section
